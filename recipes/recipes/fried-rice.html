            <p>
                Fried rice is a popular Asian dish of cooked rice stir-fried in a pan or wok with other ingredients like eggs, vegetables, meat, or seafood, seasoned with soy sauce, garlic, and other aromatics, often made with leftover rice to prevent waste.

                It's known for its versatility, allowing for countless variations and serving as a main dish or side, with origins tracing back to China's Sui dynasty.
